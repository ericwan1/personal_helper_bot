# personal_reddit_helper

So I noticed that I've been spending an inordinate amount of time lately on social media. Luckily, my iPhone has a built in widget that tells me how much time I've spent on each app. After realizing I spent more than two hours a day on the reddit app (and more on my laptop) I made the decision to delete the app. However, I still needed my daily fix of reddit. Thus, I coded this short script. When run, it grabs a certain number of hot posts from a subreddit(s) of your choosing and emails them to you. The email also contents links to the discussion and post. I've been using this script to help limit the amount of time I spend on social media, and thankfully for me, I've been able to spend only about an 30 minutes a day on reddit now.
